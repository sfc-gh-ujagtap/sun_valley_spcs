# React and Express Backend - Cursor AI Rules

## SPCS Packaging Instructions for Similar Apps

When asked to package a React + Express.js app for SPCS, follow these steps:

### Phase 1: Assessment & Code Analysis
1. **"Analyze the application structure"**
   - Read `package.json` to understand dependencies and scripts
   - Read the server files (usually `server.js` or `app.js`) 
   - Check what port the backend runs on
   - Identify if there are any database connections or external dependencies
   - Look at the React app structure in `src/`

2. **"Check the existing Dockerfile"**
   - If one exists, review it for SPCS compatibility
   - If none exists, note that we'll need to create one

### Phase 2: Server SPCS Compatibility  
3. **"Implement dual authentication strategy"**
   - Add container detection logic (`fs.existsSync("/snowflake/session/token")`)
   - Configure OAuth authentication for SPCS (reads token from `/snowflake/session/token`)
   - Maintain existing local authentication (config file or environment variables)
   - Implement dynamic host binding (0.0.0.0 for containers, localhost for local)
   - Add environment detection logging

### Phase 3: Docker Configuration
4. **"Create/update the Dockerfile for SPCS"**
   - Use multi-stage build (builder stage for React build, production stage for runtime)
   - Ensure it builds the React app (`npm run build`)
   - Serve both frontend and backend from the same container
   - Use non-root user for security
   - Add health check endpoint
   - Expose the correct port (usually 3002 or whatever the backend uses)

### Phase 4: SPCS Service Specification
5. **"Create the SPCS service specification file"**
   - Create `snowflake/service_spec.yaml`
   - Define container image path
   - Set environment variables if needed
   - Configure health check (readinessProbe)
   - Set up public endpoint
   - Specify the correct port

### Phase 5: Database Setup (if applicable)
6. **"Create database setup scripts"** (if the app uses Snowflake)
   - Analyze what databases/schemas/tables the app needs
   - Create setup SQL scripts in `scripts/` directory
   - Create validation scripts
   - Create cleanup scripts

### Phase 6: Deployment Infrastructure
7. **"Create the image repository setup script"**
   - Create `snowflake/setup_image_repo.sql`
   - Define database, schema, and image repository
   - Set appropriate permissions

8. **"Create the service creation script"**
   - Create `snowflake/create_service.sql`
   - Define compute pool with appropriate size
   - Create the SPCS service with the specification
   - Set auto-suspend policies

9. **"Create the build and upload script"**
   - Create `snowflake/buildAndUpload.sh`
   - Build Docker image locally
   - Tag it appropriately
   - Push to Snowflake image repository

10. **"Create service management script"**
    - Create `snowflake/manage_service.sql`
    - Include commands for start/stop/logs/status
    - Include service update commands

11. **"Create a complete deployment script"**
    - Create `snowflake/deploy.sql`
    - Combine all setup steps in proper order
    - Include error handling

### Phase 7: Testing & Validation
12. **"Test the Docker build locally"**
    - Build the image locally first
    - Test that it runs and serves the app correctly
    - Verify health check endpoint works

13. **"Create deployment validation steps"**
    - Add commands to check service status
    - Add commands to get service endpoints
    - Add troubleshooting queries

### Phase 8: Documentation
14. **"Update documentation"**
    - Add SPCS deployment section to README
    - Include prerequisites (Docker, Snowflake CLI, permissions)
    - Add step-by-step deployment instructions
    - Add troubleshooting section
    - Add service management commands

## Deployment Order
```bash
# 1. Database setup (if needed)
cd scripts && snowsql -f setup_database.sql

# 2. SPCS deployment
cd snowflake
snowsql -f setup_image_repo.sql
./buildAndUpload.sh
snowsql -f deploy.sql

# 3. Verification
snowsql -q "SELECT SYSTEM\$GET_SERVICE_STATUS('DB.SCHEMA.SERVICE');"
```
